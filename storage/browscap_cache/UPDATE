This cache is included with the main repository to prevent future deprecation. To update this cache, run the following commands:


./vendor/bin/browscap-php browscap:fetch
./vendor/bin/browscap-php browscap:convert --cache=<this folder path>

Folder path can be found by running "storage_path('browscap_cache')" in Laravel's tinker.
